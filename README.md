# Editor

This is a proof of concept plugin editor for Endless Sky. It is still in alpha. Current features:

- Create, load and save plugins
- Doesn't mess up your plugin structure (if system X is in X.txt and system Y in Y.txt it will respect that).
- 5 themes
- Have a look at the list below to see what you can edit.

You can build this editor like the main game or use the CD generated artifacts for your OS.
